# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

- Assist Louise with data analysis for her Kickstarter Crowdfunding Project.  Using statistical analysis and visual representation from various type of collection criteria such as but not limited to launch dates, donation amounts, production costs, types of productions etc.  

### Purpose

- The analysis will help Louise determine the best time to launch a Theater production while meeting her monetary goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

- I performed my analysis by using various types of visual representations such as stacked and cluster columns and line graphs with and without markers. I was able to use VLOOKUPS, COUNTIFS, PIVOT CHARTS, and various descriptive statistics with the original data while introducing new features to assist in the analysis.

- The specific challenge when designing the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet due to a totaling error in the data. This was determined when both the graph was not represented correctly and the totals for each column did not match.  Attention to detail is key when using any function, but in this particular case it was the greater then less then symbol and a typo that produced misinformation.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Successful Theater Outcomes gradually declined immediately following the height of May. Those productions that failed were relatively consistant throughout the year based on the launch date.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- The percentage of most successful Outcomes Based on Goal data was $4999 and below and the percentage most failed $45000 and above.    

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Minor challenges was working getting aclimated to Excel on a Mac. Professionally, I use a PC on a regular basis.  However, should I decide to work for myself one day I want to be more comfortable with Exel on the Mac.  

- Attention to detail is key.  The most minor error can contribute to several minutes of trying to retrace steps to find out where the error is.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The first conclusion is in order to have the most successful outcome it would benefit Louise to launch a production in May.  The second conclusion would to schedule a vacation during the month of October because launch dates seemed to be cancelled all together or failed drastically that month.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  The were three points at which the funding percentage was both successful and failed simultaneously. If Louise were to produce a play there would not be any cancellations.    

- What are some limitations of this dataset? A major limitation in this dataset is only representing plays.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? "Backers based on Subcategory" this would provide Louise with the information of how the backers would want their money used for a specific type of production. "Country Based on Launch Date" this would provide the possibility of the most successful launch in a particular country based on time of year.
